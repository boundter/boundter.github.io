My name is Erik and in this blog I want to share stuff about my favorite subjects. Those include Machine Learning, Math, and Physics, not necessarily in this order.

Currently I am doing my Master in Physics at the University of Potsdam. Since my Bachelor I was aways interested in nonlinear dynamics (formerly called chaos theory) and this is where I wrote my Bachelor Thesis and where I am now writing my Master Thesis.
