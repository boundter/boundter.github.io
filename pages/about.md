Hello, my is Erik. On this webpage I want to share interesting stuff, as well as
my projects. This typicallys include Machine Learning, Programming, Math, and
Physics.

Currently I am in a PhD program in the Theoretical Physics Department at the
University of Potsdam. The theme of my Bachelor's and Master's Thesis were
complex systems. Specifically the synchronization behavior of coupled units
(for example neurons) under the influence of noise or in small networks of
units. The current work is financed by the DFG in the IRTG 1740.
