## Nonlinear Systems

#### Used Tools
- CMake for building, installing and testing
- Doxygen for documentation
- Boost
  - odeint for integration of the ODEs
  - program_options for adding command line arguments
  - test for executing the unit-tests

#### Description

Nonlinear Systems is a wrapper around the odeint package for integrating systems
of differential equations. It offers helper functions and ready-made observers
that shorten the process of exploring physical systems. An added tool to add
command line options in a single line allows for a quick development of
command-line tools.

Nearly everything is unit-tested and works as intended, at least in the
considered cases. The whole lib is documented and can be quickly installed with
cmake.
