My name is Erik and in this blog I want to share stuff about my favorite subjects, Machine Learning, Math, and Physics.

Currently I am doing my Master in Physics at the University of Potsdam in Germany. Since my Bachelor I was aways interested in nonlinear dynamics (formerly called chaos theory) and this is where I wrote my Bachelor Thesis and where I am now writing my Master Thesis. But after finishing my degree I want to branch out and go into Data Science, because here all of my favorite topics meet.

This blog will cover different topics as well as different styles. I would like to write about current research as well as tutorial into rather easy topics like perceptrons.
